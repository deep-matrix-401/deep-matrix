# Pitch idea

**Summary of idea.**

- Real time detection of sign language.

**What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)**

- To leverage the gap between ordinary, deaf and speechless people, There are specializations in colleges to study sign language.
- Our idea comes to leverage the gap in a tech and automated way, so, no need for human interference.
- By monitoring deaf and speechless people hands movements, we can interpret it to an English language.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.**

- What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
  - A real time detection system that can interpret sign language.
  - Convert sign language to an Englsih language.
  - System should work for multiple differnt movements.

> ### As a deaf user, I want the program to convert my hands movements to pronounced words, so people who can not read, can listen to me.

> ### As a deaf user, I want the program to have a graphical user interface, so it is easy to be used.
